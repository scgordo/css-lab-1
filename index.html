  <h1>What I did over summer 2017</h1> 
  <p>This summer I took a vacation to Cleveland, OH. In Cleveland, I visited my girlfriend's family, spent a day at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, visited the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, and even attended the Hall of Fame game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Arizona Cardinals. While not visiting museums or various halls of fame, I also spend time in Cuyahoga National park, where there were tons of great trails and incredible viewpoints for nature that simply doesn't exist in Long Beach. While not traveling, I went through a move into a nice new apartment in Park Estates, and spent a lot of time relaxing and trying to work as little as possible.</p>
